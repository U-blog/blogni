	            	<h3>All about our experiences in USTP</h3>
	            	<h6>Posted 09/28/2018</h6>
	            </div>
	            <div class="article">
	            	<p>The blog is mainly about our experiences during our first year, well our first 4 months, of our time while being freshmen of college. It shows our ups, downs, memories, and moments of while here. Simply put, this blog mainly shows the things we went through during our time here; a culmination of our memories.</p>
	            	<p>On Late June of 2018 was the first time everyone met each other. We mostly came from different schools, some with different aspirations, but all with the same goal of getting through college. There were, at the start, 44 of us all fresh from senior highschool ready to take on the next challenge. Surprisingly, everyone was comfortable with the class they were with even if others had friends in different places over the campus. But, everyone had a great time. We were loud, unruly, and sometimes downright crazy, but that just showed how close even if it was only the first month. We also met our teachers during that month, and slowly figured out that it was best to keep close to our teachers if everyone wanted a good time.</p>
	            	<p>July came around the corner and things became hectic, but there were events to slow the pace down. The general assembly held by the Society of Information Technology Enthusiast, better known as SITE, was the first class activity that everyone had.  Everyone got a little bit closer cheering for the IT department. It was also during that month that the NSTP was introduced, which split the men and women to ROTC and CWTS respectively. Everyone had a fun time making fun of the haircuts of the boys, while the boys had a fun time on making fun of each other. It was then at this month that everyone found out that class would be suspended if heavy rain were to come, but that only happened 4 times that month. Consequently, we were behind in our subjects, and we had to make up time fast since prelims were coming in fast.</p>
	            	<p>August was here, and schoolwork was piling up. This didn’t stop the boys from continuously spending their time on the arcades though, but it was fine since they could catch-up with the studying anyway. This was however, the time where 2 of our classmates had to drop because of personal reasons. We all missed these two since the class had already bonded so much, but we had to accept it. The concept introduced by our SS103 of us being “zombies” was in our head, and we refused to give in to the thought. So, we smiled through the pain, and laughed through the fatigue. Unhealthy, but we didn’t want to be wholly pessimistic. We always wanted to make every moment something special and something we remembered, and this was clearly apparent during this month.</p>
	            	<p>If I were to be honest, as a writer, it’d be a huge disservice to not write about everything that happened during the past months, but as it’d be better since it would be in to much detail. This class has truly gone through many things, despite only knowing each other for such a short time. This class has truly bonded over the short period of time, but most of all, this class has memories to share for stories to hear.</p>
